## 🧩 **Prompt Designs for Each Type**

### 1️⃣ Comparative Analysis Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
🔍 *"Compare and contrast the benefits and limitations of using IoT-based predictive maintenance vs traditional manual maintenance in manufacturing."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Similarities: Both ensure equipment health  
- Differences: IoT provides real-time data, reduces downtime; manual is slower, error-prone  

---

### 2️⃣ Experiential Perspective Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
👷 *"As a factory operations manager, explain how implementing IoT-driven automation improved production efficiency and reduced downtime."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Real-world perspective  
- Practical benefits (energy savings, reduced human error)  
- Quantifiable results (e.g., 25% downtime reduction)  

---

### 3️⃣ Everyday Functioning Prompt  
> **Prompt:**  
📱 *"Describe how IoT-based systems work in real-time to monitor machinery, just like smart home devices track temperature and electricity usage."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Simple analogy (factory like a ‘smart home’)  
- Easy-to-understand explanation  
- Shows connection between daily life and industrial automation  

---

### 4️⃣ Universal Prompt Structure  
> **Prompt:**  
📖 *"Explain the process of predictive maintenance step by step, using IoT sensors in a factory."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Step 1: Sensors collect data  
- Step 2: Data sent to cloud/edge  
- Step 3: AI analyzes trends  
- Step 4: Alerts generated before failure  
- Step 5: Maintenance scheduled proactively  

---

### 5️⃣ Prompt Size Limitation  
> **Prompt:**  
📏 *"List 50 IoT applications in manufacturing that improve efficiency."*  
➡ **Refined Prompt:**  
*"List 10 IoT applications in manufacturing at a time until you cover 50."*

✅ **Expected Output:**  
- Prevents overload  
- Produces structured response  
- Easier to analyze in parts
